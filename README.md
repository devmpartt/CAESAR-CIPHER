# CAESAR CIPHER
 tasks with building and analyzing the Caesar, Double Caesar and Affine ciphers

This repository contains implementations of basic cryptographic ciphers as part of the Security Protocols course at Tampere University. The tasks cover encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis of classical ciphers:

Caesar Cipher: Implementation of the standard shift cipher, brute-force attack analysis, and decryption of a given ciphertext.
Double Caesar Cipher: Enhanced variation with two shift operations, analysis of security improvements, and ciphertext decryption.
Affine Cipher: Implementation of the affine transformation for encryption and decryption.
Frequency Analysis: Cryptanalysis technique to break ciphers based on letter distribution.
The implementations focus on understanding cryptographic weaknesses and the principles of secure communication.
